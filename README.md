# Network virtual chassis configuration

Ansible role that configures virtual chassis for pair of networking devices. 

The configuration of the role is done so that it shouldn't be necessary to modify the role for any configuration.
All settings can be configured by changing role parameters or by declaring new config as variable.

Please report any issues or send PR.

nxos specific: feature vpc must be enabled. if not using management vrf, vrf must be defined before on the device. Both peer keepalive source and dest IP are needed when changing VRF.
## Examples

```yaml
---


```

## Role variables

```yaml
# Define the details to be configured for nxos vPC pair (see README for examples)
vpc: { }

# If you want to see what config is generated by jinja2 template, line by line,  set this var true
vc_display_config: true

```
